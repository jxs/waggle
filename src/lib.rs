//! Implementation of the [Waggle](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/732) protocol.
//!
//! Waggle is a P2P pubsub protocol designed as a successor to Gossipsub, focused on
//! the dissemination of incrementally reconstructed objects. Objects are split into
//! pieces that peers progressively exchange until they converge on the complete content.
//!
//! # Design Highlights
//!
//! - **Per-topic streams** — Each topic uses dedicated streams. Subscribing opens a
//!   stream; unsubscribing closes it.
//! - **Random dissemination** — Publishing and forwarding select random subsets of
//!   connected peers.
//! - **Application-defined scoring** — Peer scoring is left entirely to the
//!   application. The protocol surfaces relevant events but does not bake in scoring.
//! - **Opaque identifiers** — Topics, objects, and piece metadata are opaque to the
//!   protocol; semantics are defined by the application.
//!
//! # Using Waggle
//!
//! See [`Config`] for configuration and [`Behaviour`] for the [`NetworkBehaviour`]
//! implementation.
